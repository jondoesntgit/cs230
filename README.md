Somewhere on your local machine (perhaps even inside of Dropbox), run the following in a terminal.

    git clone https://github.com/jondoesntgit/cs230

Set up your .env file to determine where on your computer, the large amounts of raw and processed data will live (ideally, not on your Dropbox folder, unless you have lots of synchronized storage space).
A default .env_example file is provided for your reference. In general, personal .env files should not be checked into version control for security purposes.
